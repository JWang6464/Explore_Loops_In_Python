# Explore Loops in Python

This short Python project covers the basics of loop structures, including `while` and `for` loops. It was completed as part of my Cognizant externship to demonstrate core programming skills and logic using repetition.

## What's Included

- **Countdown Timer** using a `while` loop  
- **Multiplication Table Generator** using a `for` loop  
- **Factorial Calculator** using a `for` loop

Each section asks for user input and uses loops to handle control flow and output. The code is written for clarity and beginner readability.

## File

- `main.py` â€” contains all 3 loop tasks

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then in terminal:

python3 main.py

## Why This Matters
Looping is one of the most essential tools in programming. This project helped reinforce control structures and user-driven logic through hands-on examples.
